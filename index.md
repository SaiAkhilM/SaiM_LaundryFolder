<!-- Replace this text with a brief description (2-3 sentences) of your project. This description should draw the reader in and make them interested in what you've built. You can include what the biggest challenges, takeaways, and triumphs from completing the project were. As you complete your portfolio, remember your audience is less familiar than you are with all that your project entails! -->

# First Milestone
For my first milestone, I set up the two main parts of my project: the improved BoxLegend (a large flat plastic board used to fold clothes) and the electronics. For the improved BoxLegend, I used parts from two BoxLegends to add an extra joint so that the machine can place a folded article of clothing aside instead of folding it and leaving the folded clothing on top of itself. I had some slight trouble with how to construct this but overall I was able to construct it by using a saw and scissors to cut the plastic and I used hot glue and a hot air gun to attach the two BoxLegends together. For the electronics, I wired my servo motors, Arduino Mega, power supplies, motor driver, and the button together. I then wrote the code and troubleshooted until I was able to get the click of a button to consecutively run the 4 servo motors 180 degrees and back. The code was pretty challenging at first since I wasn't used to the functions that controlled the servo motors and because I over-complicated the logic but in the end, I was able to simplify the code and get it to work. Next, I plan to attach the electronics to the improved BoxLegend and assemble all of that to a base so that the machine can successfully fold a shirt and place it aside.

<!-- # Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser. 

# Code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. -->

<!--```c++ 
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}

# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
- [Example 3](https://arneshkumar.github.io/arneshbluestamp/) -->

# Starter Project: DIY RGB
The DIY RGB is basically an RGB that changes colors as you adjust the three linear potentiometers which control the level of Red, Green, and Blue that is in the RGB. This starter project warmed me up for my intensive project. All I had to was solder the RGB and the three potentiometers in the correct orientation into the protoboard. I thought this was going to be easy but I soldered my RGB in the incorrect orientation so I had to spend hours removing the solder with a soldering iron and solder sucker. Eventually, I was able to resolder the RGB in the correct orientation and get the DIY RGB to work after connecting it to power.
